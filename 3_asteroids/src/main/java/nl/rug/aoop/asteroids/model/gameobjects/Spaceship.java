/**
 * This class represents a player's ship. Like all other game objects, it has a location and velocity, but additionally,
 * the spaceship has a weapon that can be used to shoot bullets to destroy asteroids. The spaceship also slows down over
 * time. You may think this is unrealistic, but imagine for a moment that this spaceship has reaction control thrusters
 * allowing it all 6 degrees of freedom, and that it has an inertial dampening system, like any modern straighter
 * would.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, the spaceship has a limited energy supply which is regenerated slowly over time by onboard solar panels.
 * Accelerating, turning, and shooting the weapon all drain some of this energy. If there's not enough energy remaining
 * to perform some action, the spaceship will simply remain idle until it has recharged its batteries.
